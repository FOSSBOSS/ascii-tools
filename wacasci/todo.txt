ok, added text vectors. the code is getting really long though, and I got a long list of things 
I want to add. 

0. Break out classes to libraries. put sub features in classes. put glyphs in a class, core functions in a class, controls in a class and so on.

1. add highlight / select text 
2. add copy paste.
3. add inline text entry more like a proper text editor.

4. make a full control panel. 
--include things like how files should be saved, 
--variables for font, charsize, H/V spaceing. 
   These are fun to play with, but harder to edit in code. 

5. figure out how to make frame generation.
6. figure out animation.
7. frame gen -> script gen.

8. add an option to save file under original name.

9. reverse (negative slope) vectors should use the opposite char of the possitive counterpart. 

10. add some command line args like file open. in the case of file open, we would either reject H,W args, or ignore them, 
becuase the file being opend has its own H,W.

11. figure out how to perform glyph miriors in context of character matrix.

12. remove lstrip("\n") from ghlyphs.

13. simplfy keybindings? Im already forgetting the bindings. its too many. Im out of keys, and still have more features to add.

14. Undo key cntl+z ?

15. find / replace

16. ..damn I forgot

Notes::
I think getting the classes busted out to libraries is top priority. 
Theres a lot of uniqueness here, and more will come, so I should start managing that better. 
Glyphs, core, special functions(like mirror, or log vectors, framing, scripting), might be the best canideates. 

In the character matrix perspective, every file is GLYPH.

# I opened a binary with this thing, it sorta renders but you cant save as a binary. .. 
I mean when ever Im done done, bless is in a sorry state, an I could really use a nice hex editor.
